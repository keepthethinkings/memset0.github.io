# jekyll-material-design-lite

This project is a combination of the [Jekyll Static Site Generator](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and [Material Design Lite](https://github.com/google/material-design-lite) styleguide implmentation from Google.

The main objective is to use this Project as a starting point for protoyping static sites and to explore the MDL features.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo using Git:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/getmarkus/jekyll-material-design-lite.git
```

Please refer to the [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and [MDL](https://github.com/google/material-design-lite) Projects for info on how to get started in each project. This project hasn't added any dependent steps to this project. However, this project has been tested in a [Docker Jekell](https://github.com/jekyll/docker-jekyll) gh-pages container (jekyll/pages) and it works well.

## Styling CSS
The CSS for this project refers to the CDN asset provided by the Material Design Lite team. The Primary and Accent colors are [configurable](https://github.com/getmarkus/jekyll-material-design-lite/blob/master/_config.yml).
